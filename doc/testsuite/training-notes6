Slide 1: no notes

Slide 2: In this final course we will look at how to generate a database for
the advanced ranking scan discussed in previous courses, plus how to configure
it so BAT can use it.

Slide 3: A good dataset is important for the ranking to work. If there is too
little data the classifications will be strongly biased to what is in the
database and programs will be wrongly identified.

The database works best if there is a wide range of software in it. Good
sources for software are open source projects and Linux distributions.

Slide 4: There is a database generation script available in the BAT source code
repository. This script processes files, but it needs to have a list of files
with some metadata (like packagename, version, and the origin of the download).
Creating this list is very easy (it is a simple format), but if there are many
source code archives that need to be processed it can be quite a lot of work.

To help with that work there is a script that can generate these lists.

Slide 5: The actual script that processes the source code files can be found in
the BAT source code repository. It extracts string constants and function names
(for C/C++ programs) and can be instructed to extract license texts from source
code if instructed to using the Ninka license scanner.

Slide 6: The Ninka license scanner can be used to extract license texts.
Installing it is a bit tricky and BAT has, right now, a few hardcoded paths for
Ninka, so it needs to be installed in a (semi-)fixed location before licenses
can be scanned with the database extraction script.

Slide 7: Similarly FOSSology can be used for extracting licenses and copyright
statements like e-mail addresses, URLs and more. For this FOSSology needs to
be installed. Installing FOSSology is quite complex, but there are ready made
packages for most distributions available.

Slide 8: The ranking scan makes use of several caching databases to speed up
scanning. These databases are created on the fly by BAT if they don't exist
yet or can be pregenerated. The caching databases contain information that is
needed by the scanning process, such as the average number of strings in a
package, string constants, and function names.

Since the caching databases are generated on the fly it means that
multiprocessing can not be used for the ranking scan if there is no fully
(pre)generated cache.

Slide 9: The locations of the main database and the caching databases are set
in the environment.

The caching databases are split per language family (strings in one language
can be very significant in one language and not in the other and vice versa).

If there is a fully (pre)generated cache the variable BAT_RANKING_FULLCACHE
should be set to 1.

Slide 10: If licensing information (determined by looking at licenses of files
in which unique strings were found) should be reported as well another
environment variable called BAT_RANKING_LICENSE should be set to 1.
